                        <p class="textindex">The ability of biomass and biofuels to contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply.</p>
                        <p class="textindex">Furthermore, biomass and biofuels consume large amounts of water and land (sometimes land that could be used for food production). Furthermore, there can be carbon leakage from biomass production. Nevertheless, it could still help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and play an important role as a method of dispatchable generation.</p>

They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts. More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe. The authors' team emphasized that their work should not be interpreted as anti-renewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions. The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity.</p>

                                    <p class="textindex1">Manufacturing of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and batteries requires significant amounts of rare-earth elements which has significant social and environmental impact if mined in forests and protected areas. Due to co-occurrence of rare-earth and radioactive elements (thorium, uranium and radium), rare-earth mining results in production of low-level radioactive waste. Mining for materials needed for renewable energy production is expected to increase threats to biodiversity.[citation needed] In September 2020 scientists published a world map of areas that contain renewable energy materials as well as estimations of their overlaps with "Key Biodiversity Areas", "Remaining Wilderness" and "Protected Areas". The authors assessed that careful strategic planning is needed. There is research into ways to recycle solar panels (including the emerging perovskite solar cells) as recycling solar panels could reduce electronic waste and create a source for materials that would otherwise need to be mined.</p>
